# Two players, who we will call Alice and Bob, take turns removing one of the coins from either end of the remaining line 
# of coins. That is, when it is a playerâ€™s turn, he or she removes the coin at the left or right end of the line of coins 
# and adds that coin to his or her collection. The player who removes a set of coins with larger total value than the other 
# player wins, where we assume that both Alice and Bob know the value of each coin.

# coins []  =  { 6, 9, 1, 2, 16, 8}

# trial 1: (players will pick the best option available for them)
# coins [] = { 6, 9, 1, 2, 16, 8} , Alice picks 8
# coins [] = { 6, 9, 1, 2, 16}, Bob picks 16
# coins [] = { 6, 9, 1, 2}, Alice picks 6
# coins [] = { 9, 1, 2}, Bob picks 9
# coins [] = {1, 2}, Alice picks 2
# coins [] = {1}, Bob picks 1
# Alice: 8+6+2 =16 Bob: 16+9+1=26 => Alice Lost

# So clearly picking up the best in each move is not good for Alice. What else Alice can do to win the game.

# trial 2: (Alice thinks about Bob's move, Will discuss the strategy in solution) 
# coins [] = { 6, 9, 1, 2, 16, 8} , Alice picks 6
# coins [] = { 9, 1, 2, 16, 8}, Bob picks 9
# coins [] = { 1, 2, 16, 8}, Alice picks 1
# coins [] = 2, 16, 8}, Bob picks 8
# coins [] = {2, 16}, Alice picks 16
# coins [] = {2}, Bob picks 2
# Alice: 6+1+16 =23 Bob: 9+8+2=19 => Alice Won
